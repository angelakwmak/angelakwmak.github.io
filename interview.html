            <h2>Question 1: Tell me about a time you used creativity and problem-solving skills to solve an important problem.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                When I first started to teach piano, I didn't know what to expect and focused too much on trying to get through the learning content in the allotted time period. After teaching the first lesson, I realised I had to change up my teaching strategy to get my students relaxed and engaged during the lessons. 
                <br><br>
                To begin, I requested my friends (who are also piano teachers) to let me sit in on their lessons so that I can observe the way that they teach. To find out what I was doing wrong, I wanted to first compare myself to other teachers. I observed my friends using games to engage their student as well as distributed prizes for incentive. After observing my friends' lessons, I also had a discussion with them for what advice they could give for a new teacher. I then took all of the data I gathered and went home to formulate some games and strategies. I understood that I would have to cater them to each individual student because they each have their own unique likes and dislikes. I used my best guess according to their ages and genders to concoct a lesson plan that is engaging for each and everyone of them.
                <br><br>
                As a result of my efforts, my students had a much more enjoyable experience during the following lessons. I learned that I must do my research to get to the bottom of a problem and not to be afraid to keep trying until I get it right.

            <h2>Question 2: Tell me about a time in a recent school term when you needed to meet several hard-stop deadlines and how you handled it.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                During my last school term in the fall of 2014, I experienced having two midterms on the same day and 3 assignments due later on that same week.  In order to be prepared for all 5 of those things, I had to plan ahead and be organized. 
                <br><br>
               Whenever I start a new term, I will always create a calendar and write down all the important dates according to all the syllabuses. After realising that I had so many things due in one week, I broke down each task into smaller tasks. For example, if there were 4 chapters required for the midterm, I scheduled to study two of them in one week for the 2 weeks leading up to the midterm. After repeating the process for all 5 of the tasks, I had myself a calendar full of items. Courses were colour coded and hard deadlines (such as the date of the midterm) were also highlighted as well. Whenever I finished a task, I would cross it off my calendar so that I know which ones I have left. Items that I did not finish would be rescheduled to the next possible date and also highlighted for importance. 
               <br><br>
               Thanks to my rigorous scheduling, I was able to get all my studying done well before my exam as well as finish all of my assignments with exceptional performance. I have used this strategy since university began and I do not plan to stop. I felt that being organized helped to significantly reduce my stress levels.

            <h2>Question 3: Describe a time when you didnâ€™t succeed at something you were trying to accomplish.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                During my high school days, I was highly involved in playing badminton and my goal was to eventually qualify for the provincial competition by placing in the top two of my category: mixed doubles. The first time I participated, I didn't even make the top 6. The second time I participated, I made 5th place. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Because my third time participating was in my final year of high school, I needed to do everything I could to accomplish my goal. I increased my training time from 5 hours a week to almost 15 hours a week. In order to gain experience, I joined every competition that I could outside of school. Through the many competitions that I joined, I was able to increase my confidence I also got to face some of the competition that we would be facing later at the qualifying rounds. My partner and I analyzed their playing strategy and formulated a plan to defeat them later. Throughout this training period, I was also studying for midterms and exams and I was under pressure because it was my final term and my marks would determine my admission into universities. I became increasingly nervous and anxious as the time for the annual competition got closer and closer. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In the end, I only ended up in third place becaused I made a mistake from being too nervous. I learned that I focus on my stress too much and that learning to cope with stress will allow me to perform better. This principle can extend to every part of my life.

            <h2>Question 4: Tell me about a time when you needed to make a difficult decision in school and what was the result.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
               Before I started university, I had chosen an economics major for myself because I believed that it would help further my career in business. After taking my first term of economics courses, I knew that it was not right for me. At this point, I felt lost and I had no idea how to further my education or if I should switch majors.
               <br>
               <br>
               I first decided to talk to my parents about my dilemna and their advice was that no matter what I decide, I should be studying what I enjoy learning. Their advice inspired me to take a variety of courses in my second term to determine which major I would switch to. I tried out legal studies, psychology, and computer science. When I came across my psychology course, the topic of study intrigued me. It is a relatively young science and I loved that there are still so much we don't understand about psychology. There was so much to explore and discover in this topic of study. I consulted my friends who were psychology majors to discuss my options before I took the leap to contact my academic advisor to change my major from econmics to psychology.  
               <br>
               <br>
               As a result of my decision, I am very satisfied with major as of now and I thoroughly enjoyed the past few years of learning about psychology. I am pleased that I opened myself to more options and took a leap of faith.
