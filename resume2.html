            <h2>Q: How did you get invovled?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I myself was once engaged in purchasing cosmetics online because there was a wider selection and I could get them for cheaper than in stores.One day I realised that if I could buy them for a lot cheaper than market value, I would also be able to sell my items for a profit! I started off by first selling the makeup that I owned as a test run to see how large the demand for the products were. After realising that many people were interested, I decided to order more products to sell. 
            <br><br> 
            My main method of marketing was through Facebook and I used a separate Facebook account (from my personal account) to manage my business inquiries. I communicated with customers through Facebook, e-mail, and text. I met up with customers in person, but only in populated locations and busy times, such as in the Eaton Center (downtown Toronto) at 12pm.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Q: What are your future plans?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In order to attract more business, I plan to bring greater convenience to customers. To accomplish this, I planned to set up a shipping method so that I would not need to meet directly with clients (which also reduces risks for me). This would require an online way to receive payment as well as a lost-cost shipping service. In addition, a website would need to be developed to place orders on. As I got busier with school, I was unable to continue developing. Seeing that I am anticipated to graduate next year, I am planning to restart the business with the new elements.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p> Below is a picture of one of my first client. She was a bridesmaid at a wedding and she asked for the simplest, polished, and natural look.<br><br>

            <h2>Q: How did you get invovled?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>At the beginning of high school, I started gaining interest in makeup. I believed that it was an excellent way of expression and that the possibilities were endless. I began to watch more and more YouTube videos in order to teach myself how to do makeup.
            <br><br>
            By the time high school ended, I was already very experienced with makeup. All of my friends and family knew. Whenever there were any special parties or events (such as prom), my friends as well as my brother's friends would ask me to help them prepare their makeup.
            <br><br>
            In first year university, the girls on the same residence floor as me also heard about my artistry and I was also asked to help out times of special events. When my cousin got married, I was also invited to do the makeup for all the bridesmaids. Because of my co-op placement in Hong Kong, I was unable to attend the wedding. My cousin then reccomended me to the makeup artist that she hired in my replacement. She happened to need help for upcoming weddings and so I joined her as her assistant. I was able to make a little bit of spending money during my school days this way.</p>

            <h2>Q: What are your future plans?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Due to my busy schedule at school, I was unable to be her assistant any longer since January 2015. One day, after I graduate, I plan to get officially licensed as a makeup artist so that I can make some extra money on the side by providing freelance makeup services on occasion. 
            <br><br>
            I treat doing makeup and learning about makeup products as a hobby and it is one of the many ways for me to relieve stress. If I had the capital and expertise, I would love to start creating my own makeup line. I believe the market for these types of products is very large and I always keep up to date with what is trending in the beauty industry. I believe that my experience allows me to understand what kinds of products people like and want.</p>
